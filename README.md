flipCounter-with-decementTo
===========================

Extending the wonderful javascript flipCounter (http://cnanney.com/journal/code/apple-style-counter-revisited/) by Chris Nanney with a decrementTo method.

The original method included an incrementTo method which animated the counter from x to y with variable duration and pace.

It was fairly trivial to extend the functionality to include a decrementTo method to animate the counter from y to x.
